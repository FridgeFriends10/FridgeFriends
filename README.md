# FridgeFriends
Mobile software to organize and optimize the use of the food you have in your fridge 

WHAT THE PROJECT DOES?
The project consists of a cooking application available in app stores that includes different recipes and allows the users to introduce new products/ ingredients bought with their expiration date, creating a link between the days until expiration and each product added to keep a record of all the ingredients that you have. Furthermore, the application would have a varied bank of recipes, from which depending on the convenience, product availability and expiration date the algorithm would output the recipes for the user to have an idea of what to cook. 
WHY THE PROJECT IS USEFUL?
The project is useful for students and young people that may not have much experience in cooking when studying and living outside their houses, to be able to know exactly what to eat, how to prepare it, what to buy, the times required so that you can organise your rest of the day, not waste awful amounts of time in the kitchen and avoid all types of food waste. With our app we aim to deliver to customers commodity and a healthy lifestyle while maintaining within their budget. 
WHO MAINTAINS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE PROJECT?
The FridgeFriends team has been contributing to the creation and development of this project and will also be responsible for the maintenance and updating of it. We also have to mention the help we have received from our early adopters which have given us very useful feedback, which has led us to make several improvements.
